Launched in 2008, within a short span of 5 years, Technorecruit.com has crossed the 1.3 crore candidate landmark and has more than 2 lakh jobs on site. 

        Today Technorecruit.com is changing the landscape on hiring, by integrating Facebook hiring solutions – making it the world’s first job site to do so. Technorecruit.com now enables a recruiter to reach out to the personal network of employees and their connections, thus giving him access to a vast network of good quality candidates. 

        It also offers better relevance of results through its database of candidates, delivered through its unique 2-way matching technology, which helps candidates get the jobs they deserve and helps recruiters hire faster. 

        Technorecruit has a large reach through its print product, Technorecruit Jobs - the Tuesday Job supplement of Hindustan Times - making it the only recruitment product with an integrated print and online offering. Technorecruit thus continues to offer significantly enhanced features and a better end-user experience for both candidates and recruiters. 

        Technorecruit is a part of HT Media Limited. HT Media is one of India's largest and most respected names in the media industry, with its footprint across print, digital and radio. </p>
